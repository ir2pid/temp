    "question":"<b>My Father’s Office</b> <br>I went to my father’s office yesterday. He works for a bank. The bank building has a big hall. The hall has many desks. Each desk is the seat of one employee. This person – the employee - sits on a chair behind the desk. Two more chairs are there in front of the employee’s desk. Visitors can use those chairs. <br>Each employee has his own set of stationery items. Like others, my father’s desk has files, pens, and wads of paper, letter tray, marker, notebook, pad, punch, stapler, paper clips and ball pens. It also has a computer workstation. A wastepaper basket is kept under the desk. A file cabinet stands at the side of his desk. Father puts his files in it at the end of the day. Finished files are kept in a big cupboard across the hall. Confidential documents are kept in a safe. The keys of the safe remain with father’s boss, the Bank Manager. I found many documents on father’s desk. Each desk had a fan on top of it. They are going to fix air conditioning machines in the office. Then the fans will not be needed. <br>A conference room is located at the corner of the hall. Meetings happen here. The door of the room closes automatically. It is well decorated. It has a bookshelf, a cupboard, a big round table and many chairs. It also has a screen with a projector. The floor of conference rooms is covered with a carpet. There are curtains on windows of this room. <br>There is a small canteen on one side of the office. It has a tea-coffee machine. People can fill their cups with tea or coffee from the machine. I was thirsty. I took a glass and drank water from the drinking water dispenser. Sometimes my father goes outside office and takes fruit juice from a shop. <br>The office hours ended at 5pm. Father put the stationery inside his desk and locked it. He put the phone directory in his briefcase. He took the last few papers from the desk and went to a small machine near the exit door. It is called the “paper shredder”. It cuts paper into numerous small pieces. He used the shredder to destroy some old papers. <br> <br>Uses to be noted: <br># Work for, at the end of the day, across the hall, remain with <br># Note passive voice in ‘wastepaper basket is kept’, ‘will not be needed’, ‘conference room is located’, ‘The floor of conference rooms is covered with a carpet’. <br># Seat (noun) vs. sit (verb) <br># Note the use of the verbs ‘put’ and ‘use’ carefully. <br># The word ‘Stationery’ is used both as singular and plural. <br> <br>Questions: <br>1.

    "question":"<b>The Mother Earth and Her Problems</b> <br>The Earth is our home. It is the only planet on the solar system that is proven to have life. The surface of Earth is covered by sea and land. Land meets sea at the coastlines. <br>The entire land mass on earth is divided into seven major areas. They are called continents. Humans have lived for centuries in six of them: Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America and Australia. Antarctica is the seventh continent. It is covered with ice and glaciers. Only a few animals like Emperor penguins and polar bears live in the Antarctic region. <br>The other continents have many types of land surfaces. The deserts are filled with sand. These areas have very little water, trees or plants. They are generally very hot and dry. Another type of land is found in the forests or jungles. These are the homes of big and small wild animals that live with a wide variety of plants and trees. The mountains and hills rise high above the sea level. The hills often have their own forests and jungles. The colder and higher levels of the mountain peaks have very low temperatures. They have ice and snow. Glaciers are also found in these high altitudes. Glaciers are rivers of ice. <br>The plain land has rivers of water. The rivers are extremely important for food habits of humans, which are dependent on agriculture. The rivers help make the land fertile for agriculture. Canals are built from rivers to take water into the crop fields. Some rivers flow into the sea. As it flows near the sea, a river becomes bigger by addition of water from other smaller rivers. However in areas with extremely soft soil, such a river can again break up into a number of small rivers in the region where it meets the sea. This area is called the delta region. Sunderbans, in India, is the delta region of River Ganga (or Ganges). <br>Land areas close to a sea-bound river are affected by tides. The tides result from earth’s daily motion as well as gravitational pull on the waters by the moon. The sea has high tide for part of the day. Water levels in sea and rivers rise during high tide. The tide gradually changes as time passes. Later in the day water levels fall below normal. This is called low tide. <br>Air and water pollution are serious problems of the modern world. The pollution in the atmosphere is leading to a condition called “global warming”. Air temperature is rising everywhere on earth due to pollution and de-forestation (cutting of forests without replacement). ‘Ice caps’ store a lot of frozen water in the North and South poles of the earth. These are melting due to temperature rise. Sea water levels are slowly rising. Many land areas near sea are slowly getting submerged under water. This is happening in some coastal areas including the Gangetic delta. <br>Humans are slowly realising the importance of keeping balance in environment. They have been late in starting damage control, but now they have begun making an effort to reduce pollution and deforestation. <br> <br>Uses to be noted: <br># At the coastlines, rise high above, dependent on, make fertile, break up into, result from, fall below (vs. rise above), leading to, getting submerged, begun making an effort <br># Note passive voice in ‘is proven to have’, ‘is covered by Sea’, ‘is covered with ice’, ‘are filled with sand’, ‘is divided into’, <br># The rivers help make the land fertile for agriculture’ is better than ‘………..help to make…’ <br> <br>Questions: <br>1. Translate the above into Bengali. <br>2. What, in your opinion, is the main problem in our mother earth ? <br>3. Do you like to move around the mother earth ? Which places do you like to visit and why ?",

    "question":"<b>Weather Changes for Aunt Sohini</b> <br>Aunt Sohini wakes up when her alarm clock rings at 5-30am. It is another new day. Another 1440 minutes. Or 86,400 seconds. Sometimes we forget how much time is there in a day. And then we can think bigger. Seven days make a week. Four weeks make a month, twelve months a year. “I wonder how many seconds there are in a decade...or a century!” Aunt Sohini smiles silently at the thought. <br>She gets ready and starts her long morning walk. She thinks, ‘India is blessed with many seasons. The colours, sounds and smells around us keep changing with time. Sometimes the changes are slow. At other times the weather around us can change so quickly.’ It is summer now. Each year we see the weather complete its full cycle of seasons. The rainy season will arrive in a few weeks. It will be followed by autumn. Then we will have winter, followed by spring. And then we will be back to another summer ! The rainy season is unique to the Indian sub-continent. This season is the main reason behind the high occurrence of food crops in these parts of the world. <br>Back to Aunt Sohini and her morning walk. The sun is out. Aunt Sohini is sweating heavily. She pauses for a few minutes before turning back for home. Suddenly the sky turns dark with rain clouds. The wind has picked up over the past ten minutes and these clouds have come from nowhere. It is a tropical thunderstorm. These are common during the hot and humid days in summer. Aunt Sohini starts her walk back. She tried to speed up. <br>A blaze of lightning flashes across the sky. The crack of thunder follows. Raindrops start coming down. Swirling winds come from all directions. The weather has turned cyclonic. Aunt is still quite some distance away from her home when it starts raining heavily. <br>She gets drenched but keeps walking. Something little and hard hits her on the head. Aunt Sohini looks around for some naughty child who may have thrown a stone at her. But there is no one in sight. Then another one falls on the road beside her. It is hail ! She spots a little shed nearby and takes shelter under it. She feels happy to hear the sound of hailstones falling on the metal roof sheet above her. She has heard this sound sometime long back, but she cannot remember when. <br>She is surprised at the quick change in weather that she just saw. She had seen it earlier this year on a winter morning. It was a car ride from Mathura to Delhi. An unending web of fog came down from nowhere and surrounded the entire area. Nothing was visible even at a small distance of 30 feet. They had to stop the car and wait for many hours. <br>Today Aunt Sohini is luckier. The wind and the rain stop soon afterwards. The overcast sky gives way to the sun once again. Aunt Sohini resumes her walk back home in wet shoes and clothes. <br> <br>Uses to be noted: <br># The above passage is written in present indefinite tense <br># Wake up, ring at, arrive in a few weeks, wind has picked up, speed up,  is surprised at, give away to <br># Smiles at the thought, keep changing with time, keep walking, unique to the Indian sub-continent, turn dark, turn cyclonic, blaze of lightening, crack of thunder, get drenched, in sight <br># We see the weather complete its full cycle’ – note that ‘to’ before ‘complete’ is not used here <br> <br>Questions: <br>1.

Their house is an open exhibition of their artwork at various ages. If you ring the doorbell, you will find a design on it. All walls in their living room, dining space and bedrooms are lined with numerous graffiti by the four artists that grew up there. Even the kitchen and toilet walls have not been spared.

    "question":"<b>Communication – The Past and the Present</b> <br>Communication is important in modern life. We speak and listen to each other from an early age. This is the earliest communication that people experience in life, after the smile. As we grow up, we learn to read and write in our languages. Remote communication begins when we start writing letters to friends and relatives who live far away. These letters are carried by messengers or postmen. In old times trained messengers were also used to transmit verbal communication across distances and sometimes trained pigeons were used as messengers of letters ! <br>These were the oldest forms of remote personal communication from one person to another. Invention of the telephone and the telegraph improved the quality of remote communication greatly. These are considered to be a big jump in the communication field. With a telephone we could speak to people at great distances away from us. The telegraph helped transmit urgent written messages quickly, instead of writing letters and waiting for them to get delivered. These messages, sent through the telegraph system, were called telegrams. <br>Then came the radio and television. To this day these are the most popular means of one-way mass communication as well as popular entertainment. <br>In the modern era the telephones are getting replaced by mobile phones and emails are taking the place of hand-written letters. This has been possible due to a communication revolution in the past few decades and the emergence of the internet. India’s great poet Rabindranath Tagore wished for a world “where knowledge is free”, because in his time knowledge was exclusively for those fortunate people who had access to educational institutions, libraries and knowledgeable people in their circles. Today the internet is a place where anyone can obtain free knowledge for all subjects on most issues. However the readers need to use a little judgment and discretion to verify authenticity of information available on the internet. <br> <br>Uses to be noted: <br># Experience as verb, trained messengers (or pigeons), across distances, considered to be, at great distances, in communication field, sent through, to this day, get replaced, taking the place of, on the internet <br># ‘Helps transmit’ is better than ‘helps to transmit’. You can use this phrase for some verbs only. <br> <br>Questions: <br>1. Translate the above into Bengali. <br>2. Do you (or your father) have a mobile phone ? If yes, what features do you use on your mobile ? <br>3. What is the most useful communication medium of a baby ?",

    "question":"<b>Our Clothing and Their Clothing</b> <br>When we meet people for the first time, clothing makes our first impression on others. Many styles of clothing are followed in India, and many more across the world. The clothing varies with local culture, past traditions as well as prevailing weather of each region. <br>A large portion of the modern world, including India, was ruled by Britain once upon a time. From that common history, a common dress code has automatically emerged in these colonial regions. The shirts and tops, the trousers, the belts, shoes, jackets, coats and blazers etc are part of this common dress code. <br>However each region retains its ethnic tradition of clothing. Ethnic wear or traditional clothes are often worn during festivities and occasions of celebration. <br>The most popular ethnic dress in India is the dhoti-kurta for men. For women it is the sari and the blouse. Along with these clothes, people also wear jewellery items like bangles, necklaces, finger rings and ear-rings. Each region has its local custom of making and wearing all of these items.

    "question":"<b>The Human System</b> <br>The human body is the most complex and interesting machine known to man. There are ten major systems in a living human. All of them work together to run this ‘machine’. <br>Sense organs are the means to receive external inputs. These are the eyes, the ears, nose, tongue and skin. <br>The muscular and skeletal system takes care of support and movement. The heart is the most important muscular tissue in the body. The hips, spine and knees are the most important skeletal joints. These should be carefully developed and handled from youth in order to avoid joint problems in advanced age. The digestive system starts from the mouth and includes the stomach and the intestines. It helps in absorbing food / water and converting it into energy and tissue. The respiratory system consists of the nose, the windpipe and the lungs. Blood carries digested food and oxygen to all other parts of the body. Blood also takes away waste products from such body parts. <br>The brain is the main controller of the body. It receives signals from various body parts and sends instructions to them through the nervous system. These main systems are supported by the endocrine system, the lymphatic system and their organs. <br>Can there be a machine which takes in fuel (food) and does not emit any waste products? Human body also sheds its wastes. The digestive system discards its wastes at the end of the intestinal tract. For removal of waste and toxic products from our circulatory system or blood, we have the excretory system. The main organs of this system are the kidneys and the anus. <br>It is very important for humans to take care of various parts of this precious machine from an early age.

    "question":"<b>My Forest Dream</b> <br>I had a dream last night. My best friend Sahadeb and I were in a strange land. We found all kinds of animals there. And they could speak ! <br>When the dream started, we stood at the edge of a river. A crocodile head rose above water. “Hello, welcome to our world. I hope you enjoy your stay here.” A stork was looking for food in the stretch of river near us. Its long legs looked like two sticks in the water. The stork picked up a little fish, and ate it without chewing. Sahadeb was surprised. “It did not remove the scales!” <br>The crocodile was also hungry. It swam off to find its breakfast. A mother duck called for her ducklings. “Come on, kids. It is safe now.” They went in for a swim. The duck family was also hungry. A mother dolphin threw herself up and did a somersault in the middle of the river. The baby dolphin watched mummy, with its snout showing above the water. <br>We turned away from the river and walked across the land. There was a big open field. The field was surrounded by a dense cover of trees. The field had a little pool of water. It was a bright, hot day. On our way we saw the head of a snake peeping out from its hole. It raised its head and looked around. “Can you spot the eagle anywhere around? I want to go out and enjoy the sun.” <br>A herd of deer passed by. They were followed by an ostrich. It stopped and stared at us. “Do I know you?” All of them went to the small pool of water for a soothing drink. Oh – two elephants were already drinking water there. The elephants entered the pool and started enjoying themselves. They used their trunks as hosepipes and threw sprays of water on each other. The tortoise was resting in the pool. It got disturbed and slowly walked out of the pool. “These rogues….” it said angrily, shaking his head. By this time wild boar and bisons had also arrived to quench their thirst. <br>Something moved in the forest bushes. The monkeys started making noise from the trees. A  peacock and a zebra ran away from the area. “Beware”, they shouted at the other animals. Sahadeb looked at me in anxiety. We thought that it might be a lion…or a tiger. Can it be a leopard or a cheetah ? After all they are also hungry and thirsty. Soon we heard more sounds in the bushes. We saw a pack of wild dogs. They had hunted a hare. All of them were trying to have a bite of the fresh food with their muzzles. “Give me space, folks!” barked one of them. That was the leader of the pack. <br>We walked to the other side of the forest. A bumblebee flew around Sahadeb. It made a buzzing sound before moving into a large flower on our left side. A butterfly greeted us. “Hi! See how many flowers we have in our forest? I am waiting for my sister to join me. But it will take some time. You want to meet her? There she is.” The butterfly points at a caterpillar on a tree. It is busy eating leaves. A beetle was crawling up the tree trunk. It was careful not to get trapped in the spider’s web. <br>Near our feet, a grasshopper played around. A frog gave it a chase. A few earthworm mounds bothered the centipede. It was not happy to see these newly built obstructions on this way. “These earthworms do not listen. They keep building mounds on my path without prior notice. I will have to move around those pile-ups. The earthworms have no legs, so they do not realize how many extra leg movements I have to make now.” The millipede, having just finished his own journey around the little soil heap, turned around and yelled at the centipede: “Then just think about me! I have thousand legs.” <br>“Hey look out!” a few shrill voices cried out. They were wasps. I had almost knocked their hive with my head. We said sorry and stepped back…..but our feet crushed a large ant mound behind us. The ants came out running and checked the damage. They were already red, so we could not tell if they were turning red in anger. “How will you feel if someone destroys your house for no reason??” The ants  shouted as they crawled up all over Sahadeb and me. We said, “Wait, we are sorry.” We ran for the water hole but there were too many ants. We were fully covered by them now. We could not breathe. They started biting us….I screamed, and woke up. It was morning.
