    "question":"<b>Man and Animal</b> <br>Sayani’s aunt stays at Satjelia in Sunderbans area of West Bengal. Sunderbans is a large area of mangrove forests. The tiger is the most famous wild animal there. Satjelia is very close to the forest area. There are no roads in this area for cars or buses. People travel from one place to another in boats. <br>Life is very difficult for people living in Sunderbans. They live close to the forest. Some of them are farmers. Many others are fishermen who catch fish and crabs from the rivers of Sunderbans. Some people go to the forest area to collect honey. They sell the honey to earn money. There is great danger in going to the forests for honey or fish. Tigers and crocodiles can attack humans in these mangrove forests and sometimes people get killed. <br>Rima’s father spoke to her on Indian forests. Many needy people live close to forests in India. Some of them depend on the forest to earn them a living. They know of the dangers of forests but cannot go far away from the forest. Humans and wild animals try to avoid each other. But sometimes they come face to face in search of food. <br>Humans are growing in number. They need more food and more space to live. They cut down forests to build houses and grow crops. But cutting of forests takes away food and shelter of animals. They sometimes come to villages for food. Elephants come to rice and maize crop fields out of hunger. Leopards can attack domestic animals and even little children in villages near the forests. In this way, increase of human population is making life difficult for humans as well as animals. <br> <br>Uses to be noted: <br># Stay at, live in, travel from/to, depend on <br># Close to, get killed, earn living, in search of, come face to face, out of hunger, make life difficult <br> <br>Questions: <br>1.

    "question":"<b>The Village</b> <br>I am an Indian village. I have big farmlands. Farmlands are also called fields. Farmers work on the land with bullock. They put seeds of crop on the land. This is called “sowing of seeds”. Rice, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, poppy are some of the crops. Rice is the main crop in West Bengal. Farmers sow rice seeds before the rainy season. Rain water helps growth of crop. Sometimes farmers also irrigate the fields. <br>After some time the seeds grow into crops. The crops become ripe. Farmers cut the ripe crops from the fields. Cutting of crops is called harvesting. These crops are kept in my storehouses. The farmers get the grains from these crops. They sell the grains and earn money. <br>Some farmers grow vegetables in their fields. After the vegetable grows, they sometimes sell it to the market. At other times, they store away their harvest of vegetables in ‘cold storages’. They sell these vegetables later. They have to pay rent to cold storage owners. <br>Farmers use one part of the money to grow more crops on my fields next time. They also spend another part of money to buy food, clothes and medicine for family. Farmers also have children who go to school. They have to buy books and pay tuition fees of school with this money. <br>I have small roads. I do not have many vehicles on my roads. City roads have many motorcycles, cars and buses. My roads have some motorcycles but only a few cars and buses. Most people in villages travel by bicycles, cycle rickshaws and cycle vans.
